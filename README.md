# WebServerCS
An easy to use light-weight webserver for dotnet

## About
> **Note: This library is a work in progress. Documentation and examples will follow.**

WebserverCS has been invented to form a bridge between a fully-featured ASP MVC app and a simple back-end system for those using front-end frameworks like Angular, React or Vue. For example, ASP comes with tons of neat features while WebserverCS doesn't. But WebserverCS makes it easier in return by giving you more control on the http flow, which ASP is more strict at. That is why WebserverCS is probably a more suitable webserver library for the more seasoned web developer who likes to get his hand dirty.
