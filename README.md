# Jarmer WebServer
An easy to use light-weight webserver for dotnet

## About
Jarmer WebServer has been invented to form a bridge between a fully-featured ASP MVC app and a simple back-end system for those using front-end frameworks like Angular, React or Vue. For example, ASP comes with tons of neat features that make it easy to setup database connections, authentication handlers, and so on while Jarmer doesn't. But Jarmer makes it easier in return by giving you more control on the http flow. That is why Jarmer is probably a more suitable webserver library for the more seasoned web developers just like me.
