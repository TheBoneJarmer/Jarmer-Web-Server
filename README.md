# Jarmer WebServer
An easy to use light-weight webserver for dotnet

## About
Jarmer WebServer has been invented to form a bridge between a fully-featured ASP MVC app and a simple back-end system for those using front-end frameworks like Angular, React or Vue. For example, ASP comes with tons of neat features that make it easy to setup database connections, authentication handlers, and so on while Jarmer doesn't. But Jarmer makes it easier in return by giving you more control on the http flow. That is why Jarmer is probably a more suitable webserver library for the more seasoned web developers just like me. Speaking of which, if you are an ASP developer or ever worked with ASP than I got some good news. You will notice that much of the structure is similar to that of an ASP MVC app.

## Work In Progress
This library is still very much a work in progress. Although I have been working on this project for much longer than the first commit's date will tell you. This is because I started with it in another, private project. But it turned out I started to need it for another private project. And instead of sharing the project reference I preferred to just make it public. Perhaps other people could use it too.
